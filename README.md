# Keep your words

## Description

Keep your words is a text editor. This text editor saves your words for the next time you want to get writing - whether online or offline. Saving offline is an important feature of an app for users who do not always have reliable internet. Perhaps you are remote or on a budget or only access the internet through wifi at your local library - you still deserve the capabilities of basic app like a text editor. 

Creating this app taught me how to strucutre my code in a new way through the client-server model. I was able to use a larger number of dev-dependencies to support my creation of this PWA. While using CRUD is a fmailiar concept, manipulating data into indexedDB was a new form of this.
